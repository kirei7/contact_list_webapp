# contact_list_webapp
This module is dependent on a 'contactlist_application' artifact, so you need to install
that module first. 
1) Then you should run 'package' maven goal and thus you get executable jar.
2) Run it (be sure your :8070 port isn't listened by any other application).
3) Go to localhost:8070/ and play with functionality.
